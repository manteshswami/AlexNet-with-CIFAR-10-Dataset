# AlexNet with CIFAR-10 Dataset
This project implements the AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using Keras/TensorFlow.

CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 32×32 color images in 10 classes (airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck).

# 🧠 Project Overview

AlexNet is a deep convolutional neural network that was groundbreaking in image classification. It was originally designed for the ImageNet challenge, demonstrating how deep CNNs can learn hierarchical image features.

In this project, AlexNet is adapted and trained to recognize images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
